# Project-Euler

Project Euler is a website that offers a series of challenging computational problems, often requiring mathematical insight and efficient algorithms to solve. The problems are designed to be solved using computer programming.

Key features:

**Problem-solving:** Each problem presents a unique challenge, requiring you to think critically and apply your programming skills.

**Mathematical concepts:** Many problems involve mathematical concepts like number theory, combinatorics, and geometry.

**Efficiency:** Solutions often need to be optimized for speed and memory usage.

This repository contains my solutions for every fully completed problem from www.projecteuler.net, along with some comments and notes from my code.
